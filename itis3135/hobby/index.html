  <h2>Home - What is Commander?</h2>
  <p>Commander is a unique Magic the Gathering format where each deck is built around a legendary creature—the Commander. In this 100-card singleton format (aside from basic lands), your Commander defines your strategy.</p>
  <p>This site is dedicated to my passion for Commander. I spend epic Friday and Saturday nights playing with my mom, her boyfriend, my girlfriend, and my two best friends. Our games can get heated and we sometimes play for hours!</p>

  <h3>My Story</h3>
  <p>My journey into Commander began as a personal quest to leave behind video games and embrace a hobby that would boost my social life. In December of 2024, I made the decision to stop video gaming and swap it for in-person card and board games. This change wasn’t just about shifting hobbies—it was a deliberate move to promote socialization and to embark on new adventures with real people around me. Although I may return to video games someday, at this time in my life, I simply can’t afford them, so I channel my passion into Commander and live for the thrill of each match.</p>
<p>Through this project, I aim to showcase not only my favorite decks and epic game moments but also the camaraderie and thrill that comes from each match. Whether it is the dramatic plays, unexpected twists, or just the fun banter, every game tells a story. Welcome to my world of Commander, where every card has a tale and every duel is an adventure.</p>

    <section id="who">
        <h2>About - Who We Are</h2>
        <p>I am a dedicated Magic the Gathering player who balances school assignments during the week with intense weekend games. My passion for Commander is fueled by strategy, creativity, and friendship.</p>
        <p>My gaming group includes my mom, her boyfriend, my girlfriend, and my two best friends. We mix friendly rivalry with shared fun to make every session memorable.</p>
      
        <p>Every game night is more than just cards, it's a full-on experience. We rotate who cooks, and everyone contributes to the feast. Bobby loves deep-frying eggrolls, my mom throws down with her legendary chicken wings and mac and cheese, and my girlfriend and I tag-team beef and noodles. My other friends? Pizza delivery pros. It's less a game night and more a celebration of food, fun, and friendship.</p>
      
        <p>Disputes? Not here. We've got a built-in solution: an AI model that acts as our official Commander rules judge. If a card interaction gets confusing, I just ask the AI—*beep boop, legal call made!* No arguments, just smooth gameplay and fair calls. It's like having our own personal digital judge at the table.</p>

    <!-- HOW Section (Gameplay) -->
    <section id="how">
      <h2>Gameplay - How We Play</h2>
      <p>Magic: The Gathering was surprisingly easy for me to pick up, mostly because I’ve been into trading card games since I was a kid. I grew up playing Pokémon from the age of 8 to 11, both casually and in official leagues. After that, I shifted into Yu-Gi-Oh! and stuck with it all the way until I was 16—playing with real cards and even battling on my Nintendo DS. I still have my full collection from the 2000s, packed with nostalgia and some cards that are actually worth a pretty penny now. Those years of strategy, deck building, and collecting gave me a strong foundation for diving into Magic, and made it feel like coming home to an even deeper game.</p>

      <p>Our Commander games mix strategy, creativity, and a bit of chaos. The format challenges players to build unique decks around legendary creatures.</p>
      <p>Every session is a blend of spell-slinging, board control, and unpredictable turns that make each game a new adventure.</p>
      <p>This image captures the setup at the beginning of a typical Commander game. Every player starts with 40 life, which we track using two D20 dice. You also begin the game with 7 cards in hand, drawn from your 100-card Commander deck. Before we start the room gets real quiet and every locks in. Sitting down at a table like this, surrounded by friends, cards, and strategy, you can feel the game coming alive before it even begins.The image below shows an example of what it looks like to sit at the table. Next time you should hide your hand though. Don't wanna expose your plan!!</p>

        <p>This Izzet deck (red and blue) is built around Niv Mizzet. The strategy is to cast spells that deal major damage, and I draw cards equal to the non-combat damage dealt to three opponents.</p>
        <p>The deck focuses on spell-slinging and board control, making each play impactful.</p>
