  <h2>Home - What is Commander?</h2>
  <script src="https://lint.page/kit/4d0fe3.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
  <p>Commander is a unique Magic the Gathering format where each deck is built around a legendary creature—the Commander. In this 100-card singleton format (aside from basic lands), your Commander defines your strategy.</p>
  <p>This site is dedicated to my passion for Commander. I spend epic Friday and Saturday nights playing with my mom, her friend, my girlfriend, and my two best friends. Our games can get heated and we sometimes play for hours!</p>

  <h3>My Story</h3>
  <p>My journey into Commander began as a personal quest to leave behind video games and embrace a hobby that would boost my social life. In December of 2024, I made the decision to stop video gaming and swap it for in-person card and board games. This change wasn’t just about shifting hobbies—it was a deliberate move to promote socialization and to embark on new adventures with real people around me. Although I may return to video games someday, at this time in my life, I simply can’t afford them, so I channel my passion into Commander and live for the thrill of each match.</p>
<p>Through this project, I aim to showcase not only my favorite decks and epic game moments but also the camaraderie and thrill that comes from each match. Whether it is the dramatic plays, unexpected twists, or just the fun banter, every game tells a story. Welcome to my world of Commander, where every card has a tale and every duel is an adventure.</p>

</section>
    <!-- WHO Section (About) -->
    <section id="who">
        <h2>About - Who We Are</h2>
        <p>I am a dedicated Magic the Gathering player who balances school assignments during the week with intense weekend games. My passion for Commander is fueled by strategy, creativity, and friendship.</p>
        <p>My gaming group includes my mom, her boyfriend, my girlfriend, and my two best friends. We mix friendly rivalry with shared fun to make every session memorable.</p>
      
        <p>Every game night is more than just cards, it's a full-on experience. We rotate who cooks, and everyone contributes to the feast. Bobby loves deep-frying eggrolls, my mom throws down with her legendary chicken wings and mac and cheese, and my girlfriend and I tag-team beef and noodles. My other friends? Pizza delivery pros. It's less a game night and more a celebration of food, fun, and friendship.</p>
      
        <p>Disputes? Not here. We've got a built-in solution: an AI model that acts as our official Commander rules judge. If a card interaction gets confusing, I just ask the AI—*beep boop, legal call made!* No arguments, just smooth gameplay and fair calls. It's like having our own personal digital judge at the table.</p>

    <!-- WHEN Section (Schedule) -->
    <section id="when">
      <h2>Schedule - When We Play</h2>
      <p>Our Commander battles are scheduled for Friday and Saturday nights. The excitement builds as we gather and draw our opening hands.</p>
      <p>Even with a busy week full of assignments, these late-night sessions are worth every minute of preparation.</p>
    
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p><em>AI Prompt: "Create a cartoonish image illustrating a group of friends playing Commander on Friday and Saturday nights, with a clock in the background"</em></p>
    
      <p>While our official start times are 7 PM on Fridays and 5 PM on Saturdays, things are always a bit flexible. Sometimes people show up late, or we take time setting up food, music, and good vibes before diving in. No one’s in a rush—we’re here to enjoy the night, not race through it. Even when someone shows up an hour late, they know a seat and a shuffled deck are waiting.</p>
    
      <p>Some of our sessions go deep into the night—our record is playing straight through until 5 AM. Most games end around 1 or 2 in the morning, especially when work or school waits the next day. But when the energy is right and everyone's hyped, we lose track of time completely. Commander has this way of pulling you in, and before you know it, hours have passed in a whirlwind of spells, combos, and laughter. We try to be responsible… but sometimes the game just doesn’t let go.</p>

        <h2>Locations - Where We Play</h2>
        <p>Most of our Commander games happen right in our living room. We push the couches aside, pull out our best playmats, and set up a table full of decks, dice, snacks, and music. It becomes more than just a room—it turns into our battleground, a safe space where strategy and chaos blend into one unforgettable experience.</p>
        
        <p>Occasionally, we like to change it up by meeting at local game stores or community centers. These spots give us a chance to challenge new players, show off our deck tech, and support our local gaming community. We’re always on the lookout for new places to duel, and we welcome suggestions from anyone who wants to join in!</p>

    <!-- HOW Section (Gameplay) -->
    <section id="how">
      <h2>Gameplay - How We Play</h2>
      <p>Magic: The Gathering was surprisingly easy for me to pick up, mostly because I’ve been into trading card games since I was a kid. I grew up playing Pokémon from the age of 8 to 11, both casually and in official leagues. After that, I shifted into Yu-Gi-Oh! and stuck with it all the way until I was 16—playing with real cards and even battling on my Nintendo DS. I still have my full collection from the 2000s, packed with nostalgia and some cards that are actually worth a pretty penny now. Those years of strategy, deck building, and collecting gave me a strong foundation for diving into Magic, and made it feel like coming home to an even deeper game.</p>

      <p>Our Commander games mix strategy, creativity, and a bit of chaos. The format challenges players to build unique decks around legendary creatures.</p>
      <p>Every session is a blend of spell-slinging, board control, and unpredictable turns that make each game a new adventure.</p>
      <p>This image captures the setup at the beginning of a typical Commander game. Every player starts with 40 life, which we track using two D20 dice. You also begin the game with 7 cards in hand, drawn from your 100-card Commander deck. Before we start the room gets real quiet and every locks in. Sitting down at a table like this, surrounded by friends, cards, and strategy, you can feel the game coming alive before it even begins.The image below shows an example of what it looks like to sit at the table. Next time you should hide your hand though. Don't wanna expose your plan!!</p>

      <h2>Why I Play Commander</h2>
      <p>I stopped playing video games because I craved real social interaction and wanted to make my last year of college more productive. Commander gave me the perfect opportunity to connect with friends and family through epic battles and clever strategy.</p>
      <p>Since shifting away from traditional gaming, I've discovered a richer, more fulfilling lifestyle. I have had more time to spend with loved ones, started blog posting, and even delved into cybersecurity research—ventures that have opened my eyes to a whole new world I wish I had known about earlier.</p>
      <p>Every Commander session reminds me that it is never too late to embrace change and grow. The game has brought a sense of community and passion into my life, proving that stepping out of your comfort zone can lead to incredible new friendships and experiences. It’s all good to start now and see where the journey takes you.</p>

      <p><em>AI Prompt: "Create a pixel art split-scene showing the contrast between video gaming and card playing. On the left side, depict the negative aspects of excessive gaming: a person alone in a dark, cluttered room with glowing screens, energy drinks, and a tired, slouched posture. The mood is cold and isolating. On the right side, show the positive aspects of playing card games like Magic: The Gathering: a brightly lit room with warm colors, friends gathered around a table, laughing and engaged in gameplay. Include cards, dice, and a cozy atmosphere. Showcase joy, focus, and connection. Make the overall style retro pixel art, with clear emotional contrast between the two sides."</em></p>
      <p><em>AI Prompt that I used to create the above AI prompt for a better image: "create a prompt to make an image in pixel art showing the sides of gaming and card playing showcase good and bad on the twosides of the images</em></p>

      <table class="gametable">

      <th>Activity</th>
      <th>Hours per Week</th>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Gaming (4 hours/day)</td>

<p>I absolutely love this new balance in my life. Since I stopped playing video games and committed to playing Commander only on two nights a week, I've discovered a whole new world of opportunities. I also gained 20 hours a week! With the extra time, I have been learning new things almost every day—from mastering magic tricks to perfecting my card handling techniques. This change has not only deepened my appreciation for the game but has also allowed me to reconnect with friends and family, start blog posting, and even dive into cybersecurity research. Every session now feels like an adventure, and I’m grateful for the new skills and friendships I’ve gained along the way.</p>
