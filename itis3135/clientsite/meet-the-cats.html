      <p>
        Gatsby is a sleek black cat known for his energetic spirit and mischievous charm. Always on the move, he zooms up and down his favorite tower as if it were his personal racetrack. His playful antics keep the household buzzing with excitement!
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to dining, Gatsby is a true gourmet. He savors every bite of his specially prepared salmon treats and has an undeniable weakness for succulent tuna tartare. Samantha often surprises him with little bites of whipped cream on a lazy afternoon, which he devours with a dignified air.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from his athletic pursuits, Gatsby loves to lounge on sunlit windowsills, where he watches the flurry of birds outside with a blend of fascination and a touch of envy. His refined taste and energetic nature make him the undisputed star of the house.

      </figure>
      <p>
        Birch is the epitome of cozy affection—a gorgeous white cat with a penchant for snuggles and headbutts. She has a heartwarming way of greeting everyone with a gentle nudge, as if to say, "I love you." Her soft purrs and warm cuddles have a magical way of brightening up any room.
      </p>
      <p>
        Food is another of Birch’s great loves. She delights in tender morsels of chicken and enjoys a little salmon treat now and then. Her favorite moments come when Samantha serves freshly baked cat biscuits, which Birch devours with an air of contentment and a slight twitch of her delicate whiskers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much like her companion Gatsby, Birch adores sunbathing. She can often be found nestled in the sunniest corner of the house, gazing out of the window at the lively birds fluttering outside—a daily ritual that she cherishes with every purr.
